# AI Game Master

**AI Game Master** is an intelligent system designed to automate the role of a game master in tabletop role-playing games (TRPGs). It facilitates immersive gameplay by handling game rules, dynamically generating narratives, and adapting the game world based on player actions.

## Project Overview

The AI Game Master aims to alleviate the complexities of managing tabletop RPGs by offering an AI-powered alternative to traditional human game masters. This system can generate game worlds, manage non-player characters (NPCs), handle encounters, and adjust the game narrative based on real-time player inputs.

## Features

- **Dynamic World Generation**: Procedurally generate game worlds, complete with geography, history, and factions.
- **AI-Driven Storytelling**: The AI tailors the game's narrative based on player choices and interactions.
- **NPC Management**: AI-controlled NPCs interact with players, react dynamically, and affect the storyline.
- **Game Mechanics Automation**: Handle complex game rules and mechanics, including encounters, dice rolling, and combat.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: The project leverages Flutter for cross-platform front-end development, with a Python Flask backend for logic and database management.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: 
  - [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) (for Android and iOS)
- **Backend**: 
  - [Python Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) (for game logic and AI)
- **Database**: 
  - Google Firebase (for player management and game data storage)
- **Additional Services**: 
  - Google Cloud (for AI and storage services)

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) installed.
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed with Flask and dependencies.


## Usage

- **World Generation**: Use the AI to create game worlds and start new game sessions.
- **Character Creation**: Design custom characters with different abilities and backgrounds.
- **Game Mechanics**: Manage real-time player interactions, combat, and story progression using the AI-powered game master.
